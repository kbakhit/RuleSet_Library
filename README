Introduction
============
Classification models are widely used in different areas such as software quality prediction, computer aided medical diagnosis, bioinformatics, pattern recognition, etc.

These can be statistical models or logical models. Logical models are more comprehensible by human experts and hence are preferred over statistical models when the reason for the classification is required.

There are many machine learning algorithms that can be used to build such models such as CART, C4.5, J48, etc.  Each of these algorithms computes few performance measures of these models but not all, others do not compute any performance measure at all. Most of these heuristics, although polynomial in time, still suffer from low actual execution time. Most of this time is spent on the evaluation of the objective function which is mostly a linear combination of performance measures of the models. In such cases, the data is abundant and it is not practical to run the heuristics every time the performance measures are required.

In any case, there is no tool which computes all  performance measures of a classification model. However, this is greatly needed as the field of optimizing such models is a very hectic one currently. However, I fixed this problem and created RuleSet library (in JAVA) that is capable of taking a set of classification models, a set of data files, and computing the performance measures of the models on the data sets in a very efficient and fast way.

The default calculations are: Correctness (Accuracy), J-Index, Precision, Recall, Sensitivity, and Specificity. However, you can define and add your own formulas that take their values from RuleSetâ€™s confusion matrices.

Classification is used in almost all areas of sciences and engineering. To the best of our knowledge, there is no tool or library that computes the performance measures of rule-based classification models. My library and tools provide this functionality and can easily be upgraded to include further performance measures if needed.

Note
====
RuleSet Library supports outputing data in Excel (.xls) format, but 
requires "JExcel" library to be added to your project's build path.
